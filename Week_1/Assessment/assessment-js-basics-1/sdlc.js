// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

1. "Planning"
2. "Analysis of Requirements"
3. "Design"
4. "Implementation"
5. "Testing & Integration"
6. "Maintain"

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."

let analysisOfRequirements = "The stage of development where a list of what stack is going to be used, what platform is going to be used, and other general platform and coding requirements will have to go into the project to get it to run"

let design = "This is where the actual software is designed and the architecture is laid out, how it's going to look, move, query, etc."

let implementation = "This is where the coding and building of the software happens and it becomes an actually realized software"

let testingAndIntegration = "This is the stage where testing of the software for bugs and final finishing touches are made to the software to make it usable and available to the public or to the users that with make use of the software"

let maintain = "The last stage where the software goes through on-going maintanence to keep the software bug free and running for however long it needs to run for"
